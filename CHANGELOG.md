Version 0.1.9.6: (Panaa)
Thanks to @neomortis1 for the contribution
Adding DSR and SE basic support (mini split and multi hm is not available yet)

Version 0.1.9.5 : (nogetrandom)
Added more options and keybinds to the UI.
Added Food Buff Reminder
I'm working on a lot of things for next update, which I wanted to have ready for this one, but they will have to wait.

Version 0.1.9.4 : (nogetrandom)
Fixed issue where the addon would fail to load if you deleted the characters current profile while logged in on another character.
Fixed wrong score calculated from timer for Rockgrove.
Fixed a few issues with editing and applying times in settings.

Version 0.1.9.3 : (nogetrandom)
Fixed the difficulty button on the panel not updating correctly sometimes.

Added extended options for nameplates and health bars when using the addons "Hide Group" function.
This is still being tested in order to improve it. For now I recommend using the options I added for name plates, to
select what settings you want for them when turning hide group off. This is not needed if you don't use this function.

Version 0.1.9.2 : (nogetrandom)
Added options for the addons own hide group function:
- decide if you want the group shown instantly when you turn it off.
- enable "Necromancer Mode" to automatically disable it without showing group members when you enter combat. (still a work in progress, and I plan to find the best ways to have it automated)

Added more shortcuts to the panel dropdown:
- port to primary house.
- open the settings menu for the addon.
- the profile name will now be sorted alphabetically in the drop down.

Version 0.1.9.1 : (nogetrandom)
Fixed issue causing an error for players using the French client.
Updated how the UI window is constructed to avoid inconsistencies.

Version 0.1.9 : (nogetrandom)
Long over due update with many fixes and some new features:
- Fixed issue where the addon would sometimes think the fight was reset in CR and AS when player is resurrected.
- Improved the Simulate function in settings and added more functionality to each trial submenu.
- Added a small panel to the UI, which can be set to be visible outside of trials, and is equipped with buttons for changing profile, changing dungeon difficulty and toggling the addons built-in "Hide Group" function. More shortcuts and options will be added later.
- Added a "+ / -" button to the main UI window, which can be used to show or hide the steps of trials, so only the title, profile and trial labels are visible along with the score, timer and vitality trackers.
- Added Rockgrove support.
- Changed saved timers for Vateshran Hollows and Maelstrom Arena to be separated from profiles, so each characters individual timers will be loaded across profiles, with an option to use the active profile to share timers from all characters with the option enabled and has the same profile set as active. First time loading this update on each character, the addon will gather that characters timers from all profiles and save the best for each step to it's personal timers.

Probably forgot to mention a minor thing or two, but I've been working on these updates for so long now that I lost track.

Version 0.1.8.4 : (nogetrandom)
Stopped "Hide Group" function from spamming chat.

Version 0.1.8.3 : (nogetrandom)
Added option to change between profiles if you want to save progression for multiple groups or purposes separate.

By default all your previously saved timers will be transferred to the "Default" profile, but from there you can reset the profile to a blank if you wish. All of your old data will be kept as is and left untouched so you can import it whenever you want to any new profile.

Each new profile will save times for MA and VH from each your characters individually, and I plan to add an option to switch to "account wide" and back without interfering with each other. I will also make it possible to copy individual steps, all trial timers and entire profiles in the menu for next update.

Also, it will remember which profile to use for each of your characters, in case you run with more than one group and use different characters for each of them, so you wont have to change back and forth all the time.

Added [Active Profile] to the UI display. For now it's centered above the timer window, but will later have options for placement and visibility.

Version 0.1.8.2 : (nogetrandom)
API bump.
Added support for Vateshran Hollows which also displays how many adds you killed.
Added new features; see info tab in settings for more info.
Changed BRP tracking. For now it displays 25 steps, which im aware is a long list, but i will be more customizable next update.

Version 0.1.8.1 : (nogetrandom)
Last update was a mess, sorry it took so long to make a new one.
